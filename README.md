This is a project that I did for a class on edX (Python for Data Science from UC San Diego).
I did a brief analysis of how the number of horror movies released has changed by decade from the 1950s to the 2010s.

The data is from the GroupLens Research Group at the University of Minnesota, and it contains rating and tagging applications from the MovieLens movie recommendation service.
It can be downloaded from this website: http://grouplens.org/datasets/
